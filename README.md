# DataStructures

### B-Tree   
B-Tree is a self-balancing search tree.  
The main idea of using B-Trees is to reduce the number of disk accesses.   
Most of the tree operations require O(h) disk accesses where h is the height of the tree.   
B-tree is a fat tree. refer https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/b-tree-set-1-introduction-2/ for more details on BTree.  
  
### Expression tree  
An Expression tree is a representation of expressions arranged in a tree-like data structure.   
In other words, it is a tree with leaves as operands of the expression and nodes contain the operators.  
Here, expression Tree is implemented in C++ Data structures and finally its value is calculated.
  
### AVL Tree  
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/
