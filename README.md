B-Tree is a self-balancing search tree. 
The main idea of using B-Trees is to reduce the number of disk accesses. 
Most of the tree operations require O(h) disk accesses where h is the height of the tree. 
B-tree is a fat tree. refer https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/b-tree-set-1-introduction-2/ for more details on BTree.
